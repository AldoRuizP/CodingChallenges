## Description

Given an array of integers, arr, where all numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once, find the number.

## Starting Point

``` python
class Solution(object):
def findSingle(self, nums):
# Fill this in.

nums = [1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6]
print(Solution().findSingle(nums))
# 3
```

## Constrains

Your solution should ideally be O(n) time and use constant extra space.
