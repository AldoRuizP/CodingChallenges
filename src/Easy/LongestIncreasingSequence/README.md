## Description

You are given an array of integers. Return the length of the longest increasing subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) in the array.

## Starting Point

``` python

def longestIncreasingSequence( x ):
  # fill this
  return

print( longestIncreasingSequence( [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15] ) )
# 6 since the longest increasing subsequence is [ 0, 2, 6, 9 , 11, 15 ]
```

None.

## Constrains

None.
