## Description

Find all words that are concatenations of a list.
That means, if your list has the items [ "cat", "dog", "catdog" ] the output should be [ "catdog" ] since that word is a concatenation of other items in the list.

## Starting Point

``` python
class Solution(object):
def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words):
# Fill this in.

input = ["tech", "lead", "techlead", "cat", "cats", "dog", "catsdog"]

print(Solution().findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(input))
```

## Constrains

None.
