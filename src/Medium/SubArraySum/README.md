## Description

You are given an array of integers. The first item in the array is the expected sum.
The rest of the array [1, n] contains a sub array which sums to the expected sum.
Find the sub array and return it, assuming that a solution will always exist.

## Starting Point

``` python
def find_continuous_k(list, k):
# Fill this in.

print find_continuous_k([14, 1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2])
# 14 is the target sum
# [2, 5, 7] is the sub array which sums to that target
```

## Constrains

None.
